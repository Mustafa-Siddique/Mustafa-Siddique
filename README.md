👋 Hi, I'm Mustafa Siddique

Founder of [Cadillacs](https://cadillacs.in)
 🚀 | Innovating in Blockchain, Web3 & Decentralized Applications

I started as a self-taught programmer building dApps and smart contracts, and over the years grew into a founder & project lead, building products that go from idea → MVP → real-world adoption.

Today, I focus less on coding every line myself and more on shaping products, guiding teams, and creating impact through blockchain-driven solutions.

💡 What I Do

Blockchain & Web3 → dApps, smart contracts, account abstraction, gasless flows, zk-proofs.

Product Leadership → Turning concepts into market-ready MVPs and scaling them.

Team Building → Mentoring devs, designers, and pushing projects beyond code.

Innovation → Exploring data integrity, decentralized identity, and new blockchain patterns.

🚀 Some Highlights

DeFa Project → Reached 150k users in 2 months post-launch.

Philblocks → A decentralized credentialing system for EdTech.

GreenOrigin → Partnered with Mauritius RTCs to build a traceability system for their products.

🌍 Beyond Code

I believe blockchain is more than technology — it's about changing systems, empowering people, and creating transparent ecosystems. I spend my time between building, mentoring, and collaborating with people who share that vision.
